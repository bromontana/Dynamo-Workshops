# Building using Dynamo
---

This first assignment will be to build a _very_ rudimentary building using Dynamo! The purpose is to help us get an understanding of where we stand with programming. 

This assignment is a well defined problem designed to give you an introduction on what it means to code. I will be making complimentary documents that can act as a guide for teaching first time programmers how to "think" like a programmer. 

## Problem Statement

Using Python and Dynamo, build a basic building that satisfies the following criteria. 

1. Has a 20'x20' foundation. 
2. Has a 18'x18' first level. 
3. Has a a roof on the second level. 

We will use the generic slab, wall, and inclined roof.

Use this as a guide. 


## Resources
If you need python resources you can use these links: 

[The Official Python 3 Documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3/) It may be a little uglier than other websires but with a little patience it can help you understand what all the functions are and what they take in/push out.

[Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com) Think of this like Yahoo Answers but for code. If you're getting an error, there's a very good chance someone else has and this is the place to find a solution! Just try searching the code you're getting and odds are there is a solution or explination that will help you get out of a coding rut. 

[Python Crash Course: Resources for Python Crash Course.](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/cheatsheets/README.html) If you like having the resources there in front of you consider printing out cheat sheets to help you understand what different functions do. I reccommend having the [Beginnerâ€™s Python Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc/releases/download/v1.0.0/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc.pdf) handy for this first exercise. There's a lot of information in these and it's easy to get carried away.
